 - Design justification (including a brief discussion of at least one alternative you considered)
 - A map of your game's layout (if applicable)
 - `cheatsheet.md`
 - Completed `rubric.md`
  
## Additional Reflection Questions
 - What was your **overall approach** to tackling this project?
 We decided to first code each place, and then code each individual day.
 - What **new thing(s)** did you learn / figure out in completing this project?
 We learned how to push/pull in github. We also learn how to use vscode and github better. How to use System.exit() and just overall, how to work in a group.
 - Is there anything that you wish you had **implemented differently**?
 We wish we had less if statements and maybe found a beter way to effeciently do it. Also, we would have like to use only one scanner.
 - If you had **unlimited time**, what additional features would you implement?
 We would have implemented graphics.
 - What was the most helpful **piece of feedback** you received while working on your project? Who gave it to you?
 The most important feedback was how we could both work on vscode together with the push/pull method. It was a group member from the shark game.
 - If you could go back in time and give your past self some **advice** about this project, what hints would you give?
 - Look at a way we could make only one scanner work across all classes. Manage your time wisely, strat early!!
 - _If you worked with a team:_ please comment on how your **team dynamics** influenced your experience working on this project.
 - We made this game from ideas that we got off from each other. We believe we me in the middle of both of our ideas.
